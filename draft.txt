backend :
- delete user
- last path
- login from two different places
- default profile picture
- search from navbar
- post comment (middleware reqbodysanitize)



note :
- click delete friend before refreshing page while other already deleted it -> won't error because findByIdAndUpdate wont error if $pull doesn't find anything
- click cancel req friend before refreshing page while other already accept it -> won't error because findByIdAndUpdate wont error if $pull doesn't find anything

---?????---
- why does req.body from multipart form did not exist on console.log in middleware, but exist in console.log in main route 


with react problems : 
- if redirect error from new page chat (/senderID/receiverID) to react page chat (chat/chatID), the chat will be created anyway, then if the user hit back and send first message again, it will somehow create another chatID, SO 2 CHAT with the same person
- wrong chatID route (loading screen)
- if send multiple messages at almost the same time (and if lag), saved message might not be in order
