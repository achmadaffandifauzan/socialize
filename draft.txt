backend :
- delete user
- chatting
- session, or cookie to keep login https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69647869/keep-user-sessions-logged-in-on-node-js-server-restart
- last path
- login from two different places
- default profile picture

- click cancel req friend before refreshing page while other already accept it -> won't error because findByIdAndUpdate wont error if $pull doesn't find anything
