backend :
- delete user
- chatting
- session, or cookie to keep login https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69647869/keep-user-sessions-logged-in-on-node-js-server-restart
- last path
- login from two different places
- default profile picture
- search from navbar
- post comment (middleware reqbodysanitize)

- DO NOT USE /:id/:anotherid directly, ALWAYS USE ex. user/:id/:anotherid

note :
- click delete friend before refreshing page while other already deleted it -> won't error because findByIdAndUpdate wont error if $pull doesn't find anything
- click cancel req friend before refreshing page while other already accept it -> won't error because findByIdAndUpdate wont error if $pull doesn't find anything

---?????---
- why does req.body from multipart form did not exist on console.log in middleware, but exist in console.log in main route 


with react problems : 
- if redirect error from new page chat (/senderID/receiverID) to react page chat (chat/chatID), the chat will be created anyway, then if the user hit back and send first message again, it will somehow create another chatID, SO 2 CHAT with the same person
- home page
- wrong chatID route (loading screen)
- DO NOT USE /:id/:anotherid directly, ALWAYS USE ex. user/:id/:anotherid (proven lead to error at some cases)
